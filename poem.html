        <h1  class="Jabber" >Jabberwocky</h1>

<h3> by Lewis Carroll</h3>

 
<pre>
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves

      <span>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:</span>

All mimsy were the borogoves,

      <span>And the mome raths outgrabe.</span>

 

<strong><em>"Beware the <strong class="Jabber">Jabberwock</strong>, my son!

    <span>The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!</span>

Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun

    <span>The frumious Bandersnatch!"</em></span></strong>

 

He took his vorpal sword in hand;

      <span>Long time the manxome foe he soughtâ€”</span>

So rested he by the Tumtum tree

      <span>And stood awhile in thought.</span>
